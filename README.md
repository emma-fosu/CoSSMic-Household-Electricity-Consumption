## Project Overview
Household electricity consumption has a direct impact on both cost savings and environmental sustainability. 
This project explores consumption patterns of 11 households in southern Germany across different times of day and seasons to understand usage behavior.   
The goal is to identify opportunities for reducing wastage and optimizing energy efficiency.  

## Key Questions Addressed
1. How is electricity consumed throughout the year and seasons?
2. How is electricity consumed throughout the day?
3. Which appliance is used the most during a period?
4. How much grid power is supplied to these households over time?
5. How much grid power is used over time?
6. How much power is generated by the solar panel over time? 

## Key Findings
- **Peak Consumption**: Highest between 6 PM â€“ 10 PM, coinciding with cooking and household activities.  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Winter consumption was ~30% higher due to heating needs.  
- **Wastage**: Sub-meter readings indicated standby power accounted for ~12% of daily usage.  


## Recommendations
- Shift non-essential appliance use (laundry, dishwashing) to off-peak hours to reduce costs.  
- Introduce smart meters or alerts for abnormal standby consumption.  
- Households should adopt energy-efficient appliances to cut consumption by 10â€“15%.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Data contained many missing timestamps.  
  - **Solution**: Used resampling and forward-fill to reconstruct time series.  

- **Challenge**: Large dataset (~2M rows) slowed processing.  
  - **Solution**: Optimized with chunked loading and vectorized Pandas operations.  

- **Challenge**: Different sheets had varying column names.  
  - **Solution**: Standardized schemas and created a merging pipeline.  

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation (with Power Query)**   
   - Columns relating to industrial areas and public infrastructure were removed.
   - The columns were indexed with **Power Query index creator**.
   - In order to calculate the differential electricity consumption of each appliance, 
   the table was duplicated with an offset index of 1;
   - These tables were merged by the index and each record was substracted from their respective cumulative appliance consumption.
   - Differential electricity consumption was computed by indexing
   - Total appliance electricity consumption from the household was calculated to create five new columns (`refrigerator`, `dishwasher`, `freezer`, `heat pump`, `cooling pump`).
   - Total electricity consumption was calculated. 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA with Pivot Tables and Charts)**  
   - Created Pivot tables to show the total electricity against time.
   - Created a Pivot table to show electricity usage throughout the day.
   - Computed the percentage usage of each appliance electricity consumption.
   - Calculated the total solar (PV) electricity generated, grid electricity imports and exports.
   - Calculated the portion of grid import consumed at a specific time.  

3. **Visualization & Dashboards (with Pivot Charts and Sliders)**    
   - Created a time-series line plot of total electricity consumption against time (years, months, quarters).  
   - Created a treemap to show the portion of electricity consumed by each appliance.
   - A single timestamp slider to filter out all the charts and tables.


## Skills Showcased
- Using **Power Query** with the **M language** to load the dataset, compute new fields and remove columns.
- **Pivot tables** with computed measures and formatting to analyse electricity consumption. 
- **Pivot charts** to visualize time series electricity consumption and appliance usage.
