## 🔍 Project Overview
Household electricity consumption has a direct impact on both cost savings and environmental sustainability. This project explores consumption patterns across different times of day and seasons to understand usage behavior. The goal is to identify opportunities for reducing wastage and optimizing energy efficiency.  

By analyzing real-world consumption data, I built a structured pipeline for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data that provides clear insights for stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw datasets collected across multiple months.  
- Explore daily and seasonal usage patterns.  
- Visualize energy consumption trends for technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for households to reduce costs and save energy.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Public household energy dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).  
- **Size**: ~2.07M rows, 9 columns.  
- **Features**: Date-time, global active power, voltage, sub-metering values, etc.  
- **Challenges**: Multiple missing values, inconsistent date-time formatting, and noisy readings.  

---

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Parsed and standardized timestamps.  
   - Handled missing values with interpolation.  
   - Merged multiple sheets into a single dataset.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics.  
   - Visualized daily, weekly, and seasonal trends.  
   - Analyzed correlation between sub-meters.  

3. **Visualization & Dashboards**  
   - Created Power BI dashboards for interactive exploration.  
   - Designed time-series plots and heatmaps in Python.  

4. **Modeling (Optional Extension)**  
   - Built a forecasting model using ARIMA to predict daily consumption.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib  
- **Other**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub for version control  

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Peak Consumption**: Highest between 6 PM – 10 PM, coinciding with cooking and household activities.  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Winter consumption was ~30% higher due to heating needs.  
- **Wastage**: Sub-meter readings indicated standby power accounted for ~12% of daily usage.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Shift non-essential appliance use (laundry, dishwashing) to off-peak hours to reduce costs.  
- Introduce smart meters or alerts for abnormal standby consumption.  
- Households should adopt energy-efficient appliances to cut consumption by 10–15%.  

---

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Data contained many missing timestamps.  
  - **Solution**: Used resampling and forward-fill to reconstruct time series.  

- **Challenge**: Large dataset (~2M rows) slowed processing.  
  - **Solution**: Optimized with chunked loading and vectorized Pandas operations.  

- **Challenge**: Different sheets had varying column names.  
  - **Solution**: Standardized schemas and created a merging pipeline.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Showcased
- **Technical**: Data wrangling, SQL queries, time-series analysis, forecasting.  
- **Analytical**: Translating raw data into actionable insights.  
- **Visualization**: Communicating findings through clear, compelling dashboards.  
- **Soft Skills**: Storytelling with data, problem-solving, and attention to detail.
