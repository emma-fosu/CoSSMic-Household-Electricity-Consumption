## Project Overview
Household electricity consumption has a direct impact on both cost savings and environmental sustainability. 
This project explores consumption patterns of 11 households in southern Germany across different times of day and seasons to understand usage behavior.   
The goal is to identify opportunities for reducing wastage and optimizing energy efficiency.  

## Key Questions Addressed
1. How is electricity consumed throughout the year and seasons?
2. How is electricity consumed throughout the day?
3. Which appliance is used the most during a period?
4. How much grid power is supplied to these households over time?
5. How much grid power is used over time?
6. How much power is generated by the solar panel over time? 

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Parsed and standardized timestamps.  
   - Handled missing values with interpolation.  
   - Merged multiple sheets into a single dataset.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics.  
   - Visualized daily, weekly, and seasonal trends.  
   - Analyzed correlation between sub-meters.  

3. **Visualization & Dashboards**  
   - Created Power BI dashboards for interactive exploration.  
   - Designed time-series plots and heatmaps in Python.  

4. **Modeling (Optional Extension)**  
   - Built a forecasting model using ARIMA to predict daily consumption.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib  
- **Other**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub for version control  

## Key Findings
- **Peak Consumption**: Highest between 6 PM â€“ 10 PM, coinciding with cooking and household activities.  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Winter consumption was ~30% higher due to heating needs.  
- **Wastage**: Sub-meter readings indicated standby power accounted for ~12% of daily usage.

## Recommendations
- Shift non-essential appliance use (laundry, dishwashing) to off-peak hours to reduce costs.  
- Introduce smart meters or alerts for abnormal standby consumption.  
- Households should adopt energy-efficient appliances to cut consumption by 10â€“15%.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Data contained many missing timestamps.  
  - **Solution**: Used resampling and forward-fill to reconstruct time series.  

- **Challenge**: Large dataset (~2M rows) slowed processing.  
  - **Solution**: Optimized with chunked loading and vectorized Pandas operations.  

- **Challenge**: Different sheets had varying column names.  
  - **Solution**: Standardized schemas and created a merging pipeline.  

## Skills Showcased
- Using **Power Query** with the **M language** to load the dataset, compute new fields and remove columns.
- **Pivot tables** with computed measures and formatting to analyse electricity consumption. 
- **Pivot charts** to visualize time series electricity consumption and appliance usage.
